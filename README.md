# 2022-Big-Data-Bowl

*A knitted version of this project can be found [here](https://donald-dinerman.github.io/2022-Big-Data-Bowl/)*.

This project is part of an annual sports analytics contest from NFL Football Operations challenging members of the analytics community to contribute to the NFLâ€™s continuing evolution of the use of advanced analytics.

The theme of the 2021-22 Big Data Bowl is to devise innovative approaches to analyzing special teams in the NFL.
 
I've performed comprehensive EDA to inform my standardized and weighted model to rank special teams players with respect to play type (e.g., punt, field goal, kickoff).
